# Resources I Found Valuable in 2022

My defining event in 2022 was the birth of our first child in Dec 2022.

Here are the resources I found interesting. Some related to kids, some related to other pursuits like DevOps, web development, and some hardware stuff.

## Books
[The Phoenix Project](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/2dc432fb-c009-4190-aaae-15c6468d666d) (2013) by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win.

I really enjoyed this. It's a novel from the perspective of someone who gets an abrupt unwanted promotion to the head of IT and then needs to turn the direction of the company around by completely reinvisioning almost every process in place in the IT department. From writing code, review and ticketing, provisioning on-prem and cloud hardware, deployments, and everything else. I'm excited to read the sister book as well: [The Unicorn Project](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/cbf30b75-b17c-4bef-983e-4a86dc92e7fc) (2019).

[Expecting Better](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/523835c7-8f5f-47b5-b8fb-9e0be6ae10d2) (2013) by Emily Oster: Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom is Wrong - and What You Really Need to Know

[Cribsheet](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b6d7e4b6-ca35-43f4-9412-0328e07817f1) (2019) by Emily Oster: A Data-Driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, from Birth to Preschool

[Emily Oster](https://emilyoster.net/) wrote a great series of books on having and raising children that dive into common questions and practices and the evidence and statistics behind them. *Expecting Better* ranges from conception to birth, *Cribsheet* from birth to preschool-age, and *The Family Firm* for early school years. Highly recommend her when looking for data-backed advice.


## Web Dev
This youtube tutorial, [Static Blog With Next.js and Markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrjeefD8sac), was the foundation for my latest website rebuild. [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) gives a simple to follow but feature rich tutorial on setting up a blog using Markdown files and Next.js. I've been looking for a blog solution using React and Markdown for a while and this stack is the best combination of simplicity and extensibility that I've found yet. Much simpler than using something like Gatsby, but still has all the rich features of Next.js and React. I even used TypeScript!

## Hardware, Networking, & Raspberry Pi
[Jeff Geerling's channel on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling). Jeff produces lots of interesting content on Raspberry Pis and home servers/networking amongst other things

The [SpaceRex](https://www.youtube.com/c/SpaceRexWill) and [WunderTech](https://www.youtube.com/c/WunderTechTutorials) youtube channels have been great resources in learning about the features and capabilities of my new Synology NAS.
